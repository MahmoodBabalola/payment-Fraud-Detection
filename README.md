# payment-Fraud-Detection

To combat online payment fraud, machine learning can be utilized as a tool for identifying fraudulent activity. This can be done by training a machine learning model to recognize patterns and anomalies in online payment transactions that indicate fraud. In order to train this model, a dataset containing information about past instances of online payment fraud is required and sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection) and the dataset includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments.
